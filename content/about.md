I am a statistician working on post-secondary issues at the University of Guelph. I work with different departments to create projections for future student counts. I also work on different program evaluations. 

The purpose of this blog is to show some of the modelling work and data manipulation in Python and R that I have previously used in my current job, and previous employment. All of the examples are based on public data, and can be fully reproduced using the post itself, or the github code associated with the post.
