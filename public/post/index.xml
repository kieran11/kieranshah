      <description>Getting draft dataAn interesting aspect of evaluating average player length is looking at their original draft position. The below code uses Basketball Reference and rvest to pull the drafts from 1985 to 2010.
This post uses the two packages rvest and the tidyverse package.
The code below looks through the NBA draft pages on Basketball Reference. It pulls the html tag table.
When the code reads in the data, the first few variables do not have assigned variable names.</description>

      <description>BallrThe ballr package provides easy to use function to access the vast data resources on basketball-reference.com.
To get historical data for a defined group of players, we first pick a few given seasons. For our example, we pick the 2003 to the 2010 seasons.
The complete code to reproduce this post can be found here

      <description>This post attempts to provide an example using simulated data of how to forecast student enrollment at a four-year college or university. It uses Markov chains with simulated data. The complete code to reproduce this post can be found here
Describe a model:In most North Americana four-year universities, students progress through the four-year curriculum, and then graduate after four years. However, some students leave after the first year, other after their third year.</description>

      <description>The two previous posts have described the data available. This post will look to survival analysis to assess time until the end of a NBA career.
The first plot looks at the Kaplan Meier curves for both minutes played and seasons played by position.
As we can see, there is not a considerable difference between positions for the minutes played Kaplan-Meier curve.
Next, we look at the seasons played:</description>
